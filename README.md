This script makes it easier to use GZDoom's new (v3.7) destructible geometry feature. It does this by assigning *materials* to lines, floors, ceilings and 3D floors based on texture (though materials can be overridden). Materials, like actors, have Health and DamageFactor properties, allowing level geometry to have strengths and weaknesses to different damage types. They also have events, allowing you to customize their behavior when they're damaged or destroyed.
